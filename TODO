_ clean up old code
_ documentation on readthedocs
_ write unit tests
_ test query strings: try allowed values in querystrings
_ better declarative factories for objects
_ better database management around tests (memory db or transactional)
_ resolve issues with ES bulk indexes

maybe:
_ custom tests with no special request params (headers, etc) should
  override auto tests?
_ scaffold for test files
_ make unittest plugin so tests are collected by unittest
_ make nose plugin so tests are collected by nose
