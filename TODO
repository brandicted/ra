_ define Ra tests DSL
  x general DSL format
  x testing an API
  x testing a resource+method
  x setting factories
  _ adding hooks
_ parse RAML and determine which tests to run for autotest
  - test HEAD /collection if defined
  - test POST /collection
  - test GET /collection
  - ...
  - for each:
    - test body: if body is defined for status code/media type, check against
      schema
    - test headers: if headers are defined, test headers
    - test query strings: try allowed values in querystrings
x collect custom tests
x make pytest plugin so tests are collected by pytest
x make a test ramses app to test everything out
x support factories for objects
x use examples in RAML as default values
_ add hooks to autotests/all tests matching a pattern (per resource or method)
_ write unit tests for Ra
_ documentation
_ test ramses-example
_ better declarative factories for objects

_ (maybe) custom tests with no special request params (headers, etc) should
  override auto tests?
_ (maybe) parse a config file for test/autotest settings
_ (maybe) scaffold for tests
_ (maybe) make unittest plugin so tests are collected by unittest
_ (maybe) make nose plugin so tests are collected by nose
