_ define Ra tests DSL
  x general DSL format
  x testing an API
  x testing a resource+method
  x setting factories
  x adding hooks
x parse RAML and generate autotests
  - test HEAD /collection if defined
  - test POST /collection
  - test GET /collection
  - ...
  - for each:
    x test body: if body is defined for status code/media type, check against
      schema
    x test headers: if headers are defined, test headers
    _ test query strings: try allowed values in querystrings
x collect custom tests
x make pytest plugin so tests are collected by pytest
x make a test ramses app to test everything out
x support factories for objects
x use examples in RAML as default values
x add hooks to autotests/all tests matching a pattern (per resource or method)
_ write unit tests for Ra
_ clean up old code
_ documentation
_ test ramses-example
_ better declarative factories for objects
_ better database management around tests (memory db or transactional)
_ resolve issues with ES bulk indexes

_ (maybe) custom tests with no special request params (headers, etc) should
  override auto tests?
_ (maybe) parse a config file for test/autotest settings
_ (maybe) scaffold for tests
_ (maybe) make unittest plugin so tests are collected by unittest
_ (maybe) make nose plugin so tests are collected by nose
