Ra
==

Source code:`<http://github.com/ramses-tech/ra>`_

Ra is a test helper and pytest plugin for testing APIs defined by RAML
files.

It is used with pytest and WebTest to write functional tests for
APIs a natural way that mirrors the structure of the RAML file.

Ra also provides default automatic testing of resources defined in the
RAML to validate responses.

Ra is designed primarily to be used with `Ramses
<http://ramses.readthedocs.org/>`_, but should be usable with any
WSGI-based app that has a RAML definition.
